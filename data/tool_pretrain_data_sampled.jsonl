Let $T$ be the tension in the string, and $\\mu$ be the linear mass density (mass per unit length) of the string.\n\n1. **Force analysis:** Consider a segment of the string with length $\\Delta x$ at a position $x$ at time $t$. The forces acting on this segment are the tension forces at both ends. The net force in the $y$-direction (vertical direction) is:\n\n   $$F_{net} = T \\left( \\sin(\\theta_2) - \\sin(\\theta_1) \\right)$$\n\n   where $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ are the angles made by the string with the horizontal at positions $x$ and $x + \\Delta x$, respectively.\n\n2. **Using small angle approximation:** For small angles, $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$.

{"input":"## Question\nConsider a scenario where we have two variables, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), each following a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 4. We generate 15 random samples for each variable to create two arrays, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). We then calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two arrays. Next, we modify the scenario slightly: we generate 100 random samples for \\( x \\) with the same parameters, but for \\( y \\), we use the square of \\( x \\) (\\( y = x^2 \\)). We again calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these new arrays.
